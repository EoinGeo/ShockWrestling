      question:
        "Who are you right now — not the character, not the reputation, but the person standing here?",
      answer: `Right now, I’m someone who finally feels honest with himself.
I spent a long time thinking I had to be a version of myself that was harder and louder just to survive. By the end of 2025, that mindset cost me perspective and it cost me joy.
This moment isn’t about reinvention. It’s about return. I took responsibility, asked for help, and came back as myself instead of hiding behind armor.
Winning the PWF World Championship matters because it came with clarity, not ego.Right now, I’m TJ Baker. Grounded. Grateful. And finally aligned.

    {
      question: "What changed between the end of 2025 and this moment?",
      answer: `I stopped pretending the losses didn’t matter.
The PLE streak, losing the Belt of Zeus at Crisis — that wasn’t bad luck. That was me being out of sync with myself. I was still working hard, but I wasn’t listening, and I wasn’t adapting. I kept trying to power through instead of recalibrate.
What changed is accountability. I took a step back and let myself learn again. I stripped things down — my approach, my mindset, even how I define success. I focused on being present instead of proving something.
Those losses didn’t break me, but they did humble me. And honestly, I needed that. They cleared the noise and forced me to get honest about who I wanted to be moving forward.
This moment exists because I finally stopped fighting myself.

    {
      question:
        "How much of this championship belongs to you… and how much belongs to Emerson Rivers?",
      answer: `This championship is mine to carry — I earned it in the ring. I won it with my hands, my heart, and every lesson I learned the hard way.
But I don’t stand here alone.
Emerson didn’t win this match for me, and he’d be the first to say that. What he did was walk beside me when it would’ve been easier to walk away. He asked the right questions when I didn’t like the answers. He reminded me who I was when I started losing sight of it.
Friendship isn’t about taking credit. It’s about showing up. Emerson showed up every time it mattered.
So this title belongs to me — but the clarity, the balance, the reason I was ready for this moment?
That part has his fingerprints all over it.
`,
    },
    {
      question:
        "Now that you’ve proven who you are, what does being World Champion actually mean to you?",
      answer: ` It means responsibility.
Not just to defend a title, but to carry it the right way. I know what it feels like to lose your footing, to disappoint people, to question whether you still belong in the conversation. Holding this championship means I don’t take any of that lightly anymore.
I don’t see this title as a reward for the past. I see it as a promise going forward. To show up prepared, to respect the people across from me, and to never forget how hard it was to get back here.
Being World Champion isn’t about standing above everyone else. It’s about standing steady when everything around you get heavy. It’s About setting a standard I’m willing to live up to on my best days and my worst ones.
